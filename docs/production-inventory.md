## 0. The big picture (read this first)

Three structural facts dominate the keep/drop decision:

1. **The product pivoted away from `docs/v2-spec.md`.** That spec describes an
   "inbox of decisions" (L1/L2/L3 zoom, snooze, summarizer, supervisor). Per
   `next-features.md`, the inbox model was **dropped on 2026-06-01** in favor of
   the per-agent workspace model. The spec is now part-aspirational.

2. **RESOLVED (removed July 2026): the orphaned classifier + `/items` inbox.**
   The original compile flagged an entire orphaned backend subsystem — a
   classifier (`NeedsInput / Error / Stuck / Done`) writing priority-ranked items
   to SQLite and serving them over `/items`, `/items/stream`,
   `/items/:id/action`, with no live consumer. That whole stack has since been
   **deleted** from claudemon: `src/classifier/` is gone, the `/items` routes are
   gone, and `store/schema.rs` now creates only `sessions` + `events` (the
   v2-spec `pending_decisions`, `asks`, and `events_fts` tables are gone too). The
   dead renderer client chain (`claudemonItems.ts` → `ItemDetailOverlay.tsx`) was
   removed alongside it. The claudemon `/sessions/:id/summarize` (Haiku) endpoint
   was also removed in this cull. The SQLite store is now purely session/event
   cold-storage for resume-after-restart.

3. **One triage system, not two.** With the classifier pipeline removed, the
   renderer's live triage surface is the only one: `InboxDrawer` +
   `AttentionContext`, fed from live `ClaudeSessionSnapshot` ambient state. The
   "two inbox systems" duplication called out in the original compile no longer
   exists.

Everything else is mostly healthy. Remaining decisions concentrate in: a couple
of dead renderer files, two "Phase 2" placeholder panes, and platform gaps
(macOS/Linux cookie import, tray/overlay icons). Daemon auto-restart and
SIGTERM/SIGKILL delivery — flagged as gaps in the original compile — are now
built (see §2/§3).

## Decisions taken (2026-06-13)

| Decision | Outcome | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Classifier + `/items` + SQLite inbox | Parked as experimental on 2026-06-13; **later REMOVED entirely (July 2026)** — `classifier/`, `/items` routes, and the SQLite items/`pending_decisions`/`asks`/`events_fts` tables all deleted | ✅ removed |
| Dead renderer client chain (`claudemonItems`, `claudemonSessions`, `ItemDetailOverlay`) | Deleted (dead regardless of the park) | ✅ done |
| Other dead renderer files (`WorkingTimer`, `terminalQueries`, `ScrollIndicator`) | Deleted | ✅ done |
| NotesPane | **Finished** — real per-agent markdown scratchpad, persists with the session | ✅ done |
| AgentPane placeholder + `'agent'` pane type | Removed | ✅ done |
| `docs/v2-spec.md` | Deleted (superseded) | ✅ done |
| claudemon/hub auto-restart on crash | Implemented (exponential backoff supervision) | ✅ done |
| SIGTERM/SIGKILL delivery to sessions | Implemented (`pty::signal_child`, real POSIX signals) | ✅ done |
| Pre-existing renderer typecheck errors (KeybindingsConfig, createTerminal decl) | Fixed in passing | ✅ done |

**Still open (as of the 2026-07-05 refresh):** macOS/Linux Chrome cookie import;
tray/overlay icon; git merge / `review_diff` next-action wiring; stale E2E
`claudePane.test.ts`; untested main-process services. (The experimental SQLite
tables `pending_decisions` / `asks` / `events_fts` that were left in place with
the parked stack have since been removed — see the classifier cull in §0 and §3.)

### DEAD CODE (renderer) — RESOLVED
The dead renderer files flagged in the original compile have all been deleted:
`ItemDetailOverlay.tsx`, `lib/claudemonItems.ts`, `lib/claudemonSessions.ts`
(the dead `/items` client chain), plus `components/claude/WorkingTimer.tsx`,
`lib/terminalQueries.ts`, `components/ScrollIndicator.tsx`, and the
`ItemDetailOverlay.test.tsx` test. None remain in the tree.

> `InboxPane` (mentioned in old docs) no longer exists; live equivalent is `InboxDrawer`.

## 3. claudemon — Rust daemon (`services/claudemon`)

| Feature | Location | Status | Keep? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hook intake (`/hook`, `/hook/:kind`, `/statusline`) + deferred-hook gate | `daemon/hook.rs` | WORKING | |
| Session state machine (in-memory, DashMap) | `session/state.rs`, `session/store.rs` | WORKING | |

| Transcript read + conversation tailer (SSE deltas, seq-join) | `session/transcript.rs`, `session/conversation.rs` | WORKING | |
| Event/hook/statusline SSE streams (`/events`, `/hooks/stream`, `/statusline/stream`) | `daemon/api.rs` | WORKING | |
| Git (review pane) — MOVED to the desktop host (`apps/desktop/src/main/services/gitService.ts`, exposed as `git:*` IPC + `git.*` hub capabilities). Was `daemon/git.rs`. | — | MOVED OUT OF CLAUDEMON | |
| External wrapper + in-daemon PTY (WebSocket protocol) | `wrapper/*`, `protocol.rs` | WORKING | |
| `claudemon watch` TUI | `tui/*` | WORKING (cli.rs comment calls it a "stub" — misleading) | |
| `claudemon init` (merge hooks into settings.json) | `daemon/init.rs` | WORKING | |
| Cross-provider handoff (`POST /sessions/:id/handoff`) | `daemon/api.rs`, `session/handoff.rs` | WORKING — builds a deterministic brief, persists to `~/.workspacer/handoffs/` unless `no_persist`; successor spawns with the composer pre-filled to read it | |
| Live permission-mode switch (`POST /sessions/:id/permission-mode`) | `daemon/api.rs` | WORKING — no restart, conversation untouched (claude via shift+tab screen, adapters via provider flag) | |
| Live model switch (`POST /sessions/:id/model`, `GET /providers/:provider/models`) | `daemon/api.rs`, `daemon/spawn.rs` | WORKING for adapter providers; PTY (claude) sessions switch via the `/model` slash command on the message path | |
| PTY-bytes SSE (`pty.bytes` events) | `daemon/api.rs` | WORKING — bridged to the hub bus, consumed by the headless `brain` + web/TUI/mobile clients | |
| ~~Classifier (NeedsInput/Error/Stuck/Done + idle sweep)~~ | — | **REMOVED (July 2026)** — `src/classifier/` deleted; live triage is the renderer `InboxDrawer` fed by snapshots | |
| ~~Inbox items API (`/items`, `/items/stream`, `/items/:id/action`)~~ | — | **REMOVED (July 2026)** — routes and `store/items.rs` deleted | |
| SQLite session/event cold-storage | `store/mod.rs`, `store/schema.rs` | WORKING — now only `sessions` + `events` tables; `load_recent_sessions` rehydrates the in-memory list on boot so prior agents reappear as resumable | |
| ~~Summarizer (`/sessions/:id/summarize`, Haiku)~~ | — | **REMOVED (July 2026)** with the classifier cull | |
| Signal delivery (SIGTERM/SIGKILL to child) | `daemon/spawn.rs`, `wrapper/mod.rs` | WORKING — non-SIGINT signals routed via `pty::signal_child` (real POSIX signals); SIGINT still delivered as a Ctrl-C byte; shutdown sends SIGKILL | |
| ~~Terminal emulator (vt100)~~ | — | **REMOVED (July 2026)** — `session/emulator.rs` deleted; viewers get raw PTY bytes (emulation lives client-side) | |
| ~~SQLite `pending_decisions` / `asks` / `events_fts` tables~~ | — | **REMOVED (July 2026)** — v2-spec tables deleted from `store/schema.rs` (only `sessions` + `events` remain) | |

| Test suite | — | **NONE** (only terminal key-encoding unit tests) | |

> wks-tui now defaults to the **hub bus** (auto-spawning the hub + headless
> `brain`); pass `--direct` for the standalone claudemon-HTTP path. The `/items`
> API it never used has since been removed.

## 5. hub — Go control-plane (`services/hub`)

> **Security:** for the remote-sharing threat model (loopback default, tailnet
> deployment, token-in-URL, sandbox caveats), see
> [`docs/remote-sharing-security.md`](remote-sharing-security.md).

| Feature | Location | Status | Keep? |
|---|---|---|---|
| In-memory pub/sub broker (drop-not-block) | `internal/broker` | WORKING (5 tests) | |

| Claudemon SSE→bus bridge | `internal/claudemon` | WORKING (integration-tested spine) | |
| Layout document service (get/set/persist/broadcast) | `internal/layout` | WORKING (4 tests) — **remote tmux-mirror, all 4 phases** | |
| `/remote` web client + xterm mirror | `cmd/hub/remote.*` (embedded) | WORKING (client side; needs a capability provider) | |
| `/m` mobile-first remote client | `cmd/hub/main.go` `/m` route, `cmd/hub/mobile.html` (embedded) | WORKING (client side) | |
| Headless `brain` capability provider | `cmd/brain/*` | WORKING — provides the agent view + capabilities off the bus so web/TUI/mobile clients work without the desktop app; `--scope full` (headless, owns the session store) or `--scope catalog` (file-backed subset, runs alongside the desktop app); env `WKS_BRAIN_SCOPE` | |
| Bus topics `agent.snapshot` / `agent.statusline` / `pty.bytes` | `cmd/brain/store.go`, `internal/claudemon` bridge | WORKING — the lightweight agent-list + statusline + live-terminal feeds all clients subscribe to | |
| `/app/` full web app proxy | `cmd/hub/main.go:115` | WORKING (needs `--webapp-dir`) | |
| Plugin manifest + loader + installer (GitHub/tar.gz, zip-slip guard) | `internal/plugin` | WORKING (14 tests) | |

| Example: rules-engine plugin | `examples/rules-engine` | WORKING (full engine, no tests) | |
| Example: rivet-bridge plugin | `examples/rivet-bridge` | WORKING (needs external `rivet` binary; one-project limit) | |
| Example: agent-dashboard plugin | `examples/agent-dashboard` | WORKING (hardcoded bus URL, no token) | |
| Example: clock-plugin | `examples/clock-plugin` | WORKING — but `emits: example.clock.tick` is **declared, never published** | |
| Per-plugin capability grants (verb + path scoping) | `internal/bus/rpc.go` (`authorize`), `internal/capspec`, `internal/bus/policy.go` | WORKING — a plugin is authorized only for the capability methods (verbs) its grant declares, and path-scoped methods (`fs.*`, `search.project`) are confined to the grant's canonical, symlink-resolved roots; unauthorized calls are denied ("plugin not authorized for capability") | |
| "Ask the fleet" supervisor agents | — | **NOT BUILT** in hub — only named in rivet-bridge comments; renderer AskPane is the real surface | |
| Auto-surface MCP-spawned sessions as panes | README "next milestones" | **NOT BUILT** | |

## 6. Cross-cutting decisions to make

These are the genuine keep/drop / finish/cut calls (not obvious cleanups):

1. ~~**Orphaned classifier + `/items` + SQLite inbox stack (claudemon).**~~
   **RESOLVED — dropped (July 2026).** The classifier, `/items` routes, SQLite
   items store, and the dead renderer client chain were all deleted; claudemon's
   SQLite is now session/event cold-storage only. The live `InboxDrawer` is the
   canonical triage surface.

2. ~~**Two inbox systems.**~~ **RESOLVED** — only the live `InboxDrawer` remains
   (see #1).

3. **`docs/v2-spec.md`.** Deleted per Decisions 2026-06-13 (superseded).

4. **Phase-2 placeholder panes.** Partially resolved: NotesPane was finished and
   the AgentPane placeholder + `'agent'` type were removed (Decisions 2026-06-13).

5. ~~**Daemon supervision & signals.**~~ **RESOLVED.** claudemon/hub now
   auto-restart on crash with exponential backoff (`RestartBackoff`), and
   claudemon delivers real SIGTERM/SIGKILL to child sessions via
   `pty::signal_child` (a runaway session can be cleanly killed).

6. **Platform gaps.** macOS/Linux Chrome cookie import (NOT BUILT); tray icon /
   overlay badge (NOT BUILT). Keep Windows-only, or implement, or cut cookie
   import entirely?

7. **Git review loop.** Read/stage/commit/push work; `merge` + `review_diff`
   next-action wiring is open. Finish the loop or leave manual?

8. **Stale/missing tests.** E2E `claudePane.test.ts` is architecturally stale;
   many main-process services untested. Fix before calling it production-ready.

9. **Example plugins.** Keep all four as shipped examples, or trim
   (clock-plugin's emit is fake; rivet-bridge needs an external binary)?
