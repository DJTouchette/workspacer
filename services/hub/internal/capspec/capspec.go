// Package capspec is the small, dependency-free vocabulary shared between the
// bus (which enforces capability grants) and the plugin loader (which validates

// import cycle and keeps the list of filesystem-scoped capabilities in exactly
// one place, so enforcement and validation can never drift apart.

// PathParam maps a capability method to the params field that carries the
// filesystem path it operates on. A method present here is "path-scoped": a
// plugin must declare path roots to be granted it, and the bus confines each
// call to those roots (see the bus's path-containment policy).
//
// This is the single source of truth for "which capabilities touch the
// filesystem". Add a method here the moment it grows a path argument, or it will
// be grantable to plugins without any path confinement.

// of the (canonical, absolute) roots; it is empty for non-path methods. Defined

// the bus, and the bus can accept them without importing the loader.
