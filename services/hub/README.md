# workspacer hub

The control-plane daemon for workspacer. It runs **independently of the UI** so
it can broker events between sidecars/plugins, supervise those processes, and
(later) host an MCP facade that lets Claude Code drive workspacer headlessly.

Deliberately separate from `claudemon` (which stays focused on Claude sessions)
— claudemon becomes the *first producer* on this bus, not the bus itself.

## Status

- **M1 event bus** ✅ — pub/sub broker with **non-blocking fan-out** (slow client
  gets events dropped + counted, never stalls others), one bidirectional
  **WebSocket** per client (`/bus`), `/health`.
- **M2 supervisor** ✅ — spawn / health-check / restart-on-crash / graceful stop
  (SIGTERM then SIGKILL), lifecycle reported as `sidecar.*` events.
- **M3 claudemon bridge** ✅ — consumes claudemon's `/events` SSE and re-publishes
  each session update as an `agent.state_changed` event. claudemon is now the
  first producer on the bus.
- **M4 capability router** ✅ — request/reply over the same WS. Providers
  `register` method names; callers `call` them; the hub routes the call to the
  owning provider and the reply back, correlating by a global id. Handles no-
  provider, provider-error, provider-disconnect, and timeout. The hub never
  *executes* a capability — it routes. (This is the seam the MCP facade plugs
  into.) Authorization is enforced per-connection: a per-plugin token may only
  `call` the capabilities its manifest declared (path-scoped ones confined to
  granted roots), `publish` the event types it declared in `emits`, receive only
  those in `consumes`, and `register` as a provider only for methods in
  `provides`. The host token is trusted (full access). See "Plugin
  authorization" below.

All tested with unit + end-to-end tests, clean under `-race`. `integration`
proves the full event spine (claudemon SSE → bridge → broker → bus → client);
`bus/rpc_test.go` proves the capability round-trip + every failure path.

- **M5 plugin system** ✅ — `plugin.LoadDir` reads `<dir>/<name>/plugin.json`
  manifests (id, server, panes, hotkeys, capabilities, events); `plugin.Manager`
  supervises each plugin's sidecar (via M2), emits `plugin.loaded`/`unloaded`,
  and exposes manifests at `GET /plugins`. Run with `--plugins-dir`. See
  `examples/clock-plugin/` for a working one (a webview pane + a hotkey).
  Plugin panes get the app theme injected as `--wks-*` CSS variables — see
  [docs/plugin-theming.md](docs/plugin-theming.md). A sidecar receives its
  merged setting values (manifest defaults + the user's overlay) as a
  `WKS_SETTINGS` JSON env var at spawn; writing new values via
  `/plugins/settings` restarts the sidecar so they take effect (webviews get
  the same values live via `window.__WKS_SETTINGS__` / the
  `plugin.settings.changed` event instead).

### Plugin authorization

A plugin only gets what its manifest declares — the same "ask for it to be
granted it" model on every bus verb. Each plugin connects with its own token
(the host/main-process link is *trusted* and bypasses all of this); an untrusted
connection is confined by four manifest fields:

| Manifest field | Grants | Bus verb enforced |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `capabilities` | methods it may **call** (path-scoped ones confined to declared roots, canonicalize-then-contain) | `call` |
| `provides` | methods it may **answer** as a provider | `register` (disallowed methods dropped; ack lists what registered) |
| `emits` | event types it may **publish** | `publish` (undeclared type → error) |
| `consumes` | event types it may **receive** | delivery (a broad `subscribe`, even `"*"`, is capped to these) |

Patterns use the bus topic syntax — exact, `prefix.*`, or `*` — matched by
`internal/event.Matches`. Everything fails closed: a field left empty grants
nothing. In particular a plugin cannot drive the app by publishing a `command.*`
event unless it declared that emit — commands normally go through a granted
`call`. Grants are built by the plugin loader (`grantsFor` / `eventGrantsFor`)
and enforced in the bus (`conn.mayCall`/`authorize`, `mayPublish`, `mayConsume`,
`mayProvide`). Tested in `bus/event_authz_test.go` + `bus/rpc_test.go`.

Wired into the app: Electron main spawns the hub, connects as a client,
forwards events to the renderer, **provides** capabilities (`agents.list`,
`agents.sendMessage`, `notifications.post`), and the renderer consumes plugin
contributions — injected **pane types** (rendered as webviews), command-palette
entries, and **hotkeys** (`open-pane:` / `emit:`).

Wire the bridge into the running daemon:

```sh
go run ./cmd/hub --claudemon-events http://127.0.0.1:7891/events
```

- **M6 MCP facade** ✅ — `cmd/mcp` is a standalone MCP server that connects to
  the hub as a capability **caller** and re-exposes each capability as an MCP
  tool, so Claude Code (or any MCP client) can drive workspacer headlessly. It
  is a thin adapter: a tool call becomes a bus `call`, the provider (Electron
  main) executes it, the reply becomes the tool result. The facade never touches
  workspacer state — it routes, exactly like the hub. Reusable client lives in
  `internal/busclient`. See [MCP facade](#mcp-facade) below.

## MCP facade

`cmd/mcp` exposes the hub's capabilities as MCP tools over HTTP. It serves two
transports off the same server — `/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, the current MCP HTTP
transport) and `/sse` (legacy SSE) — plus `/health`.

```sh
# hub first (the bus), then the facade pointed at it
go run ./cmd/hub --addr 127.0.0.1:7895
go run ./cmd/mcp --addr 127.0.0.1:7897 --hub ws://127.0.0.1:7895/bus
# (pass --token / $HUB_TOKEN when the hub requires auth)
```

Attach it to Claude Code via `--mcp-config`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workspacer": { "type": "http", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:7897/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Tools (each maps 1:1 to a hub capability provided by Electron main):

| Tool | Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_agents` | `agents.list` | List running agents + state/usage/pending asks |
| `get_transcript` | `sessions.transcript` | Read a session's transcript |
| `spawn_agent` | `agents.spawn` | Start a new Claude Code agent; returns its sessionId |
| `create_terminal` | `terminals.create` | Open a new shell PTY; returns its sessionId |
| `send_message` | `agents.sendMessage` | Send a prompt to an agent |
| `approve` | `claude.approve` | Resolve a permission prompt (yes/no/always) |
| `answer` | `claude.answer` | Answer an AskUserQuestion picker |
| `signal` | `claude.signal` | Send a signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM/…) |
| `terminal_input` | `sessions.terminalInput` | Write raw bytes into a PTY |
| `notify` | `notifications.post` | Show a desktop notification |

The `spawn_agent` / `create_terminal` tools require the matching capabilities to
be registered by Electron main (`src/main/services/hubCapabilities.ts`); the
session runs headless in claudemon and a desktop pane can attach to it later.

Next milestones: per-method capability tokens (the `SetAuthorize` seam) →
surfacing MCP-spawned sessions as panes in the UI automatically.

## Headless brain (`cmd/brain`)

The capabilities above (`agents.*`, `claude.*`, `sessions.*`) are normally
*provided* by the Electron main process — so they only exist while the desktop
app is running. That's why the TUI bypasses the hub and re-implements a slice of
that logic itself.

`cmd/brain` is a standalone **provider** that fills the gap: it connects to the
hub bus and registers the core agent capabilities headlessly, backing each by
claudemon's HTTP API plus the same profile/argv logic the app and TUI use. Run
it (instead of, or alongside, the desktop app) and any caller — the MCP facade,
the web client, a future thin TUI — gets the surface **without a GUI open**.

```sh
# hub + claudemon already running, then:
go run ./cmd/brain --hub ws://127.0.0.1:7895/bus --claudemon http://127.0.0.1:7891
# (pass --token / $HUB_TOKEN when the hub requires auth)
```

**Spawning every backend.** `agents.spawn` mirrors the desktop capability's full
dispatch: `provider` (`claude` default | `codex` | `opencode` | `pi`) routes
non-Claude backends — and Claude on `transport: "stream"` — through claudemon's
`POST /sessions/spawn-managed` (model/effort/resume/permissionMode ride; codex
`transport: "stream"` spawns headless), while PTY Claude keeps the classic argv
spawn with profiles, `--resume`, and cols/rows. Same security rule as the
desktop: a bus caller can **never** auto-bypass approvals —
`skipPermissions`/`bypassPermissions`/`yolo` are forced off with a warning;
other permission modes pass through. (Per-spawn Library MCP servers and the MCP
facade wiring remain desktop-only for now.)

### Letting the hub supervise it (one source of truth)

You don't have to run the brain by hand — the hub can spawn and supervise it, so
the bus always has a provider:

```sh
go run ./cmd/hub --brain-scope full      # headless: the brain provides the whole surface
go run ./cmd/hub --brain-scope catalog   # alongside the app: brain owns only the file-backed subset
go run ./cmd/hub                          # --brain-scope off (default): no brain
```

The hub passes its own bus URL/token/claudemon settings to the brain and restarts
it on crash. `--brain-bin` overrides the binary path (default: a sibling `brain`
next to the hub binary, then PATH — `make build-hub` puts it there).

**Live session store (full scope).** Beyond request/reply, a full-scope brain
follows claudemon's `/events` stream and keeps a live snapshot per session in
memory: `agents.list` / `sessions.snapshot{,s}` answer from it, and every change
is pushed to the bus as an **`agent.snapshot`** event, so clients render live
instead of polling. (In catalog scope the desktop app owns this, so the brain
skips it.) Snapshots are **enriched** with a custom name, parent, and supervisor
flag — from spawn metadata (`label`/`parentSessionId` recorded at spawn) and the
persisted cwd→name renames in `~/.config/workspacer/tui-names.json` (the same
file the TUI writes) — so a headless `agents.list` matches the desktop's
named/nested view. Live cost/context follows claudemon's high-frequency
`/statusline/stream` and is pushed on a lighter **`agent.statusline`** event
(sessionId + status line) rather than re-publishing the whole snapshot.

**PTY over the bus (the live terminal).** `sessions.attachTerminal` starts a
lease-gated forwarder: one SSE consumer of claudemon's `/sessions/:id/stream`
(base64 chunks, first frame replays the ring buffer), republished onto the bus as
**`pty.bytes.<sessionId>`** events (chunks coalesced ~60fps to avoid flooding
clients). `terminalKeepalive` refreshes the 20s lease; `detachTerminal` (or a
lapsed lease, swept every 5s) stops it, so the brain never streams a session
nobody is watching. Input/resize flow back through `sessions.terminalInput` /
`terminalResize`. A port of the desktop's `terminalShare`. With this the TUI can
drop its claudemon-direct path and become a thin bus client — the next step.

**`--scope` / `--brain-scope`** controls *which* capabilities the brain registers,
because the bus router is single-owner per method: two providers for the same
method would collide. So when the brain runs **next to the desktop app**, it
takes scope `catalog` — the file-backed "source of truth" subset (config,
profiles, library, layouts, saved sessions, models, session discovery, host file
reads) — and the app keeps owning the live/enriched agent + streaming caps. Run
**headless**, the brain takes `full` and provides everything.

To make the desktop app a pure *consumer* of the brain for the catalog (one
source of truth, nothing registered twice), three things are needed on the
Electron side — left as a follow-up because they need a desktop build to verify:

1. spawn the hub with `--brain-scope catalog` (and `--claudemon <url>`) in
   `hubDaemon.ts`;
2. stop registering the catalog methods in `hubCapabilities.ts` (guard those
   `registerCapability` calls) so the brain is the only provider;
3. ship the `brain` binary alongside `hub` in the package (`build:hub` +
   electron-builder), so the supervised binary exists.

Capabilities registered today:

| Capability | Backed by |
| --- | --- |
| `agents.list` / `sessions.snapshots` | claudemon `GET /sessions` |
| `sessions.snapshot` | claudemon `GET /sessions/:id` |
| `agents.spawn` | profile→argv + claudemon `POST /sessions/spawn` |
| `terminals.create` | shell argv + claudemon `POST /sessions/spawn` |
| `agents.sendMessage` | claudemon `POST /sessions/:id/message`, PTY fallback on 409 |
| `claude.approve` / `claude.signal` | claudemon `POST /sessions/:id/{approve,signal}` |
| `claude.answer` | typed into the PTY (`option`/`text`/`answers[]`), like the app |
| `claude.gate` | claudemon `POST /sessions/:id/gate` |
| `sessions.terminalInput` / `sessions.terminalResize` | claudemon `POST /sessions/:id/{input,resize}` |
| `sessions.transcript` / `sessions.conversation` | claudemon `GET /sessions/:id/{transcript,conversation}` |
| `claude.profiles.list` / `add` / `update` / `remove` | `~/.config/workspacer/claude-profiles.json` |
| `claude.listModels` | static aliases + config defaults + live models from claudemon |
| `config.get` / `reload` / `getPath` / `save` | `~/.config/workspacer/config.yaml` (defaults + deep-merge, like the app) |
| `layouts.list` / `save` / `delete` | `~/.config/workspacer/layouts/*.yaml` |
| `sessions.list` / `load` / `save` / `delete` | `~/.config/workspacer/sessions/*.yaml` (saved workspaces) |
| `library.list` / `save` / `remove` | global/project markdown + `.claude/{skills,agents}` |
| `claude.sessionsForDir` | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded>/*.jsonl` (resume picker) |
| `app.getCwd` / `app.supervisorHome` | host process cwd / `~/.workspacer` |
| `fs.listDir` / `fs.listEntries` / `fs.read` / `fs.write` | the host filesystem (listEntries is gitignore-aware via `git check-ignore`) |
| `search.project` | host `rg` (ripgrep), gitignore-aware |
| `notifications.post` | logged + acked (no desktop to raise an OS notification) |

The endgame is for
every client (app, TUI, web, MCP) to be a thin caller of this one brain, so they
mirror each other by construction instead of duplicating logic across TS/Rust/Go.

**Not yet provided headlessly** — what's left is genuinely coupled to the GUI
process, not just unported:

- **Live PTY/event streams** — `sessions.attachTerminal` / `keepalive` /
  `detachTerminal` and `fs.watch` / `fs.unwatch`. The byte/event stream needs a
  hub proxy (the web client's terminal share is the template). This is the
  separate "streaming" phase and the real unlock for moving the TUI fully onto
  the bus.
- **`analytics.*`** — backed by the app's SQLite history DB, which is populated
  by the desktop session store's capture at turn boundaries. Without that
  capture pipeline there's nothing to serve, so the brain can't fake it.
- **`agents.spawn` supervisor / `mcpFacade` extras** — installing the
  `/supervise` skill and injecting the MCP-facade argv (mcpConfig/supervisorSkill)
  is app-specific orchestration; the core spawn (profile→argv) is provided.

Also: saved-session `save` persists the blob as given — it skips the desktop's
terminal-cwd enrichment, which needs the GUI's in-process pty→cwd map.

## Protocol

Clients open one WebSocket to `ws://<addr>/bus` and exchange JSON frames.

```
client → hub:   {"op":"subscribe","topics":["agent.*"]}
                {"op":"unsubscribe","topics":["agent.*"]}
                {"op":"publish","event":{"type":"agent.spawned","source":"plugin.x","data":{...}}}

hub → client:   {"op":"hello"}
                {"op":"subscribed","topics":[...]}      // ack
                {"op":"unsubscribed","topics":[...]}
                {"op":"event","event":{...}}            // a delivered event
                {"op":"error","error":"..."}
```

Capabilities (request/reply):

```
provider → hub: {"op":"register","methods":["agents.list","agents.sendMessage"]}
caller   → hub: {"op":"call","id":"req-1","method":"agents.list","params":{...}}
hub → provider: {"op":"call","id":"<global>","method":"agents.list","params":{...}}
provider → hub: {"op":"result","id":"<global>","result":{...}}   // or op:"error"
hub → caller:   {"op":"result","id":"req-1","result":{...}}      // or op:"error"
```

Event envelope: `{ id, type, source, time, data }`. The hub stamps `id`/`time`
if the publisher leaves them blank.

Topic patterns: exact (`agent.spawned`), namespace wildcard (`agent.*`), or all
(`*`).

## Run / test

```sh
go run ./cmd/hub --addr 127.0.0.1:7895
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
```

The single bidirectional connection (vs claudemon's SSE-down/POST-up split) is
intentional: publish and subscribe share one pipe, which keeps plugins simple.
